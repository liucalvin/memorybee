# memorybee

A flashcard app to help you learn new english vocab, that automatically generates definitions and example usages. Instead of making you mindlessly recite definitions, this app helps improve your memory by training your brain to understand the words in different contexts (not scientifically proven)

Built in React with Chakra UI, and Node js backend with PostreSQL database and JWT token for user authentication.

Definitions and examples requested using Axios from https://www.wordsapi.com/
